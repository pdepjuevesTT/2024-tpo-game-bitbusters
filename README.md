# Tetris

Henk Rogers argued vigorously with Minoru Arakawa, founder and then president of Nintendo of America, to include Tetris in the Game Boy box.

> “If you want to sell the Game Boy to **thousands of kids**, let it come with Mario. But if you want to sell the Game Boy to **millions of people**, it has to come with *Tetris*.”

## Instalation Guide
### **1 ) Download:**

To install the game it is necessary to download the [latest version of the source code](https://github.com/pdepjuevesTT/2024-tpo-game-bitbusters/releases/latest)

### **2 ) Decompress:**
Once the compressed file has been downloaded, it must be unzipped.

If this installation is performed on Windows 10 or higher, it is not necessary to install external programs. Just open the archive and place the folder inside in any folder of your choice.

If this installation is performed on any other operating system, then you can probably find your way without help.

### **3 ) Preparation of the environment:**

Once we have our folder with the game files, the only thing we need to do before we can play is to extract the Wollok executable that is used to run the program.

Inside the **"files"** folder there is a **"wollok.zip"**:

You have to unzip the file and place the executable **"wollok.exe "** in the **"files"** folder (the same one where the compressed file is located).

The easiest way to perform this task is with the **"Extract Here"** function of most file decompression programs.

### **4 ) Play:**
To run the game just open the **"runGame.bat"** file located in the root folder of the game.

This program will automatically open a terminal window and start the game in your default browser.

The browser only displays the game being processed in the terminal window, so it is vital that the terminal window remains open (although it can be in the background or minimized without problems).

To close the game just close the terminal window and the browser tab will stop refreshing.

### Game Rules:
*Classic Tetris*. It would be surprising to find a person born in the last century who knows how to use an electronic device and can't learn to play just by watching the game for ten seconds.

Whether playing alone to pass the time or break a record, or playing against another person to prove who has the greatest tetromino mastery, Tetris is all about placing pieces on a board to form lines and score points. Completing multiple lines in a single move grants more points and the speed of the pieces accelerates over time to keep the difficulty increasing steadily.

In the one-on-one “VERSUS” mode, the winner is decided by whoever scores the most points, even if the winner is the first to run out of space on their board.

> “He who laughs last laughs best, unless he does not have enough points, otherwise he may be the other laughs the most.”   
> \- Sun Tsu, The Art Of Tetris
